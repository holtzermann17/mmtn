Starting with some general questions...

Can I make a table of triples, where each slot is something arbitrary,
not some specific thing like a "string"?  -- I think the answer is:
yes, just don't specify the :type option.

- However, it is probably better to make a table of Things, and make
the Triples refer to id numbers of Things.

Can I make it so that the id number is automatically incremented when
I add things to this particular table of items, like we did with SQL?

- Yes; but I have to make the auto-incrementer "by hand".  The same
apparently goes for other SQL features like identifying all of the
entries in a table that match a given predicate.

Do I need to specifically list the relid, if that's what I want the
btree to be indexed by?

- Maybe what I need to do is put TRIPLES into precisely one slot,
and then index that one slot.  I don't think that it is completely
necessary for the triples themselves to be persistent, but I will
want to check this out.
