MUSN==MULTI-USER SEMANTIC NETWORK

M ~ see Monster Mountain
U ~ see musn.lisp
S ~ <to be written>
N ~ see database.lisp

Here's how my Lisp starts:

(asdf:oos 'asdf:load-op 'mmtn)
(asdf:oos 'asdf:load-op 'musn)

(in-package musn)
(database-start)

(in-package mmtn)

(start-server
 :port 4143
 :client-main-function #'musn::welcome
 :client-input-function #'musn::input)


Note: if you aren't me, then you'll probably need to modify the
function `postmodern-start' (from database.lisp) so that it connects
to the appropriate database.


Agenda items

1. More interesting "semantic" behavior
2. Improved user interactions
