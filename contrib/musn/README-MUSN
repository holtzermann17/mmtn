MUSN==MULTI-USER SEMANTIC NETWORK

M ~ see Monster Mountain
U ~ see users.lisp (in progress)
S ~ <to be written>
N ~ see database.lisp

To fire up a connection to the database,

(in-package musn)
(database-start)

Note: if you aren't me, then you'll probably need to modify the
function `postmodern-start' (from database.lisp) so that it connects
to the appropriate database.

Agenda

1. Simple user interactions
2. More interesting "semantic" behavior
