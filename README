REQUIREMENTS
------------

 * SBCL (tested with 0.9.16)
 * Bordeaux threads (http://common-lisp.net/project/bordeaux-threads)

SBCL is necessary because Monster Mountain uses the sb-bsd-sockets API
for networking. I'm currently working on getting support for passive
(connection-accepting) sockets into usocket
(http://common-lisp.net/project/usocket). Once my patch is accepted,
I'll be able to port Monster Mountain to usocket.
